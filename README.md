Data Science portfolio

I would like to address a few insights/concerns if you have already gone through the project

What are my goals for these projects? 
I aim to do quick comparisons of most common data science projects and how good Auto ML models perform against them 

I have a few things for you to understand before you go through the project 
The goal is not to maximise accuracy, it is to implement and try both in a very quick manner(Time constraint was set so that both types of models took equal time to code)
Secondly I have made ‘mistakes’ on purpose like introducing data leakage, or skipping pipeline processes in some situations, so as to inflate accuracy and to compare it with the Auto ML algorithms and how it compares with overfitted models and the lot. 

I have focused on techniques like SMOTE, Scaling, Hyper-parameter tuning and other techniques on different problems due to the time constraint I set for myself, please go through the different projects to get a rounded idea.
